## TODO:
- [ ] Implement additional AIs
    - [ ] Recursive minimax (maestro)
    - [ ] Recursive minimax but choose lowest score (dumbo)
    - [ ] Random but checks ahead for win in next move, chooses if it exists (smarto)
    - [ ] Replace recursive minimax with transposition table look-up
- [ ] Refactor whole code:
    - [ ] Tidy up UI code and event handlers
    - [ ] Use 1-d array for UI
    - [ ] Use bit boards for storing board state and checking win conditions
    - [ ] Review and document code, remove unused everything
